      The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder is used in the above links.
      During the build process, it will be replaced with the URL of the `public` directory.
      Only files within the `public` directory can be referenced from this HTML.

      Unlike paths like "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", the "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" path
      ensures correct operation with both client-side routing and non-root public URLs.
      Learn how to set up a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
